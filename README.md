# Stop-Loss Protocols For ACALA EVM Decentraklized Exchange Using Chainlink Oracles as a Trigger

Roadmap : I won't be able to start working on this project before April 2nd because of existing work commitments but the current roadmap is to build the backend in the first week of April and a very simple demo frontend to show how the stop-loss protocols work in real-time.
